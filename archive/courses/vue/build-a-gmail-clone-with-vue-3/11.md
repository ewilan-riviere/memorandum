# Multi-select with Reactive Sets

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-11-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-11-start)

We’ve had these checkboxes sitting to the left of each email for a while, but we haven’t done anything with them. In the next four lessons, we’re going to connect them to app-wide state, add a select-all checkbox at the top, then add a Bulk Action Bar and apply those actions to the checked boxes.

For this lesson, we’re going to use a Set and a Reactive object to track which checkboxes are checked.

We’ll want an `emailSelection` object which can toggle an email as selected, and has a list of selected emails. We might use it something like this - note that we have the `@click` event and the `:checked` binding both connected to the `emailSelection` object.

```html
<table class="email-table">
    <tbody>
        <tr v-for...>
            <td>
                <input type="checkbox" :checked="emailSelection.emails.has(email)" @click="emailSelection.toggle(email)" />
            </td>
            ...
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

A naive implementation of this would use an Array, and then implement some extra code for `has`. Here’s some pseudocode for what we’ll be putting in the setup function.

```javascript
let emailSelection = {
selected: [],
toggle(email) {
if(emailSelected) {
removeSelection()
} else {
addSelection()
}
}
}
```

`emailSeIected` and `removeSelection()` would each take multiple lines, or at least one longer line, to implement if we used in Array… but if we use a Set, then they both come built-in.

```javascript
let selected = new Set()
let emailSelection = {
selected,
toggle(email){
if(selected.has(email)) {
selected.delete(email)
} else {
selected.add(email)
}
}
}

```

`has` , `delete`, and `add` do exactly what you’d expect.

Now let’s test this. We’ll add a console.log in our toggle function, and then display the size of the set in the template.

```javascript
{{emailSelection.emails.size}} emails selected
<table class="mail-table">
    <!-- ... -->
</table>
```

However, we have a problem. The console.log shows the correct number of checkboxes selected, but template still says there are 0 selected.

That’s because the `selected` set referenced by the template is not changing when the email is toggled. Let’s fix this by making it reactive, using the new Vue 3 Reactivity API.

```javascript
import { reactive } from 'vue';
//...
setup() {
//...
let selected = reactive(new Set())
let emailSelection = {
selected,
toggle(email){
if(selected.has(email)) {
selected.delete(email)
} else {
selected.add(email)
}
}
}

return {
emailSelection,
...
}
}
```

If you want to know more about `reactive`, I recommend [the VueMastery series on Vue 3 Essentials](%5Bhttps://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-essentials/setup-and-reactive-references%5D(https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-essentials/setup-and-reactive-references)), especially video 2 and 5.

And now our selection is working! In the next lesson we’ll go over how to share this data over multiple components in different parts of your app.
