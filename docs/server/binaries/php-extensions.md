# PHP extensions

{{ $frontmatter.description }}

## About

Traditional PHP extensions can be installed with `apt` like `mysql`, `xml`, `curl`, `gd`, `mbstring`, `zip` or `intl`. You can see more about in [this guide](/server/binaries/php#install-extensions).

But some extensions like `swoole`, `imagick` or `pcov` need to be installed manually. A package manager called [PECL](https://pecl.php.net) can be used to install PHP extensions, but it's not recommanded because it's not always up-to-date. You can see more about in [this guide](/server/binaries/pear).

::: warning
Today, some extensions are maintained and some are not, check errors if you have it and check issues on extensions GitHub repositories to find solutions. For extensions listed here, you can install it with PHP 8.2.
:::

### Add manually extension

When you compile manually and extension, sometimes it's not added to your PHP installation. You have to add it manually.

::: info
Keep in mind when you install an extension, it is available only for the PHP version you compiled it with.
:::

Find your `php.ini` file.

```sh
php --ini
```

Use any editor to add extension.

```sh
sudo vim /your/path/to/php.ini
```

In your `php.ini`, add this to the first line.

```ini
extension="<extension>.so"
```

### Verify extension

Check if PHP can use extension.

```sh
php -m | grep <extension>
```

If you see `extension`, extension is ready.

### For Windows

If you use Windows, installation guide is available in [seperate guide](/systems/windows/php-extensions).

## Extensions

### ImageMagick

_ImageMagick, invoked from the command line as magick, is a free and open-source cross-platform software suite for displaying, creating, converting, modifying, and editing raster images. Created in 1987 by John Cristy, it can read and write over 200 image file formats. It is widely used in open-source applications._

### Redis

_The open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker._

::: info
To use Redis with PHP, you can use `phpredis` extension OR `predis/predis` composer package. `phpredis` is a C extension and is faster than `predis/predis` which is written in PHP. So, for production, it's recommended to use `phpredis` extension.
:::

- GitHub PECL (PHP extension): <https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis>
- PECL (PHP extension): <http://pecl.php.net/package/redis> with `redis`
- GitHub `predis/predis` (Composer package): <https://github.com/predis/predis>
- Official website: <https://redis.io/>

::: warning
You have to install Redis before you install PHP extension. You can check [this guide](/server/binaries/redis).
:::

To install this extension, you can install **PHP extension** OR **composer package**.

#### PHP extension

::: info
It's recommended to use `phpredis` extension for production because it's faster than `predis/predis`.
:::

Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis.git
cd phpredis
```

Compile from source

```sh
phpize
./configure [--enable-redis-igbinary] [--enable-redis-msgpack] [--enable-redis-lzf [--with-liblzf[=DIR]]] [--enable-redis-zstd]
make
```

Install

```sh
sudo make install
```

- [Verify extension](#verify-extension)

#### `predis/predis` composer package

::: info
Predis is a Redis client written entirely in PHP and does not require any additional extensions. It's not as fast as `phpredis` extension but is easier to install.
:::

```sh
composer require predis/predis
```

::: warning
If you use `predis/predis`, you don't need to install `phpredis` extension but `predis/predis` is not as fast as `phpredis` extension.
:::

#### Usage

##### Laravel

To use Redis with Laravel, you have to set your Redis client in your `.env` file.

```env:.env
# for phpredis
REDIS_CLIENT=phpredis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

```env:.env
# for predis/predis
REDIS_CLIENT=predis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

###### RedisException : Connection refused

Check if Redis server is running.

```sh
sudo systemctl status redis
```

If it's not running, start Redis server.

```sh
sudo systemctl start redis
```

###### Class 'Redis' not found

If you use `phpredis` extension and you have this error, check if extension is enabled.

```sh
php -m | grep redis
```

If it's not enabled, enable it with [Add manually extension](#add-manually-extension) guide.

If you use [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet), reinstall Valet.

```sh
valet install
```

### SQL Server

::: warning PHP 8.2
For PHP 8.2, even manual compilation, you will have maybe some errors. A [pull request](https://github.com/cataphract/php-rar/pull/18) offer to fix this problem, in some months PR could be accepted. But even with this bug, PHP and `rar` extension will work.

## Troubles

### `pcre2.h` file not found

On macOS you need to install `pcre2` and link it to current PHP version.

```sh
brew install pcre2
```

Check current versions

```sh
ls /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pcre2/
ls /opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/
```

Link `pcre2` to current `php`.

```sh
ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pcre2/YOU_VERSION/include/pcre2.h /opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/YOU_VERSION/include/php/ext/pcre/pcre2.h
```

::: info Script

You can use this script to execute all steps.

```sh
php_version=$(php -v | grep ^PHP | awk '{print $2}')
pcre2_version=$(ls /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pcre2/)
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pcre2/$pcre2_version/include/pcre2.h /opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/$php_version/include/php/ext/pcre/pcre2.h
```

:::

### Attempt to perform an operation not allowed

If you have an error like this

```sh:output
attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy `PDF' @ error/constitute.c/IsCoderAuthorized/408.
```

Check you have `ghostscript` installed with `gs --version`. And if it's okay, open `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml` to remove some lines

```xml:/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
<!-- disable ghostscript format types -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" /> -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS2" /> -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS3" /> -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPS" /> -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" /> -->
<!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" /> -->
```

### VSCode with PHP Intelephense

With [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client), you can add `imagick` to your `settings.json`.

```json
{
  "intelephense.stubs": ["imagick", "rar"]
}
```

### Scripts

You can add extension with a script.

Find PECL extension directory

```sh
pecl_path=$(pecl config-get ext_dir)
```

Find PHP configuration file

```sh
phpini_path=$(php -i | grep /.+/php.ini -oE)
```

Copy extension to PECL extension directory and add extension to PHP configuration file

```sh
sudo cp ./modules/<extension>.so $pecl_path
sudo echo "extension=<extension>.so" > $phpini_path
```

#### Example

::: info
After compilation, you can use this script to add `rar` extension.
:::

You will find PHP extension here: `~/php-rar/modules/rar.so`. To use it, find PECL extension directory.

```sh
pecl_path=$(pecl config-get ext_dir)
phpini_path=$(php -i | grep /.+/php.ini -oE)
sudo cp ~/php-rar/modules/rar.so $pecl_path
echo "extension=rar.so" | sudo tee -a $phpini_path
```

Now you remove local `php-rar`.

```sh
rm -r ~/php-rar
```
