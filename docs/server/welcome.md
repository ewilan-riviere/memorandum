# Server

This section is dedicated to how to setup a server and deploy your applications. I use Debian, so majority of commands are for Debian, but you can use any other OS.

::: warning
I advice to always verify the commands and adapt them to your needs.
:::

You can begin with:

- [Connection & user](/server/administration/connection-user)
- [Vim](/server/administration/vim)
- [ZSH & Oh my ZSH](/server/administration/zsh)
- [Basics & UFW](/server/administration/basics-ufw)
- [SSH](/server/administration/ssh-scp-rsync)
