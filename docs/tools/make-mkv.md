# MakeMKV

From: <https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-rip-blu-rays-for-your-plex-library/>

Download binary from [**MakeMKV website**](https://www.makemkv.com/download/), available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Even if you use the free version of MakeMKV, you'll need a beta key, which gets refreshed every so often on [MakeMKV's Support Forum](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1053). When you run MakeMKV for the first time, do this:

- Open the 'Help' tab and choose Register
- Copy and paste the beta key into the 'License key' field, then select 'OK.'
- Restart MakeMKV

Whenever the beta key expires, go back to MakeMKV's Support Forum and grab the new beta key, assuming it stays in beta (which has been ongoing since 2010).

Latest key is valid until March 2025: `T-h1LzyYnZ0QwBXDvKmzQOOOCyPbS30k2dlxINBG5jrCQ54b6uYXDJfbrhViFlcZ_TUk`

## How to Rip Your Blu-ray Disc

Now that you have the right software and proper hardware, grab your Blu-rays, and let's get to work.

- Launch MakeMKV and insert your Blu-ray into your Blu-ray drive.
- In MakeMKV, set 'Source' to your Blu-ray drive.
- Under the 'File' tab, select 'Open disc' and choose your Blu-ray, which MakeMKV will scan. When it's done, you'll see a list of files, like subtitles, audio, and the movie itself.
- From here, you can decide what you'd like to keep. I'd uncheck anything your Plex server will have no use for. For example, if you don't need Spanish subtitles (or audio), then you can get rid of them. Regardless, make sure 'Title' is checked, as that is the movie itself.
- Under 'Output folder,' select a destination for the file, then click the 'Make MKV' button to finalize.

The process will take some time, considering Blu-rays are rather big, especially 4K UHD Blu-rays. Even DVDs take a couple of minutes to be boiled down to a single file. So, make some coffee while you wait. Given how large Blu-ray files get, be sure you have a proper storage device for it, such as a NAS device.
