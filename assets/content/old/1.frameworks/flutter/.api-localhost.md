title: API with localhost
description: ''
---

Flutter cannot communication directly with a Vhost, the app need a online API, like <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com> and **NOT** <http://laravel-app.localhost> (a supposed Vhost with NGINX or Apache2 for example). To communicate with localhost API, you need to use tunnelling service like **ngrok** or **expose**.

## Easy way

You can use `10.0.2.2` to replace `locahost`, just like that. Here you have an example with Laravel localhost

```dart
String _api = 'http://10.0.2.2:8000/api'
// Instead of 'http://localhost:8000/api'
```

## ngrok

To use API with Flutter app, you can't directly use localhost VHost, it's necessary to use [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com) (you need to create free account to get auth token).

**1 - Install ngrok**

**ngrok** on Linux : [github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok/issues/447](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok/issues/447)

::code-group
  ```bash [Windows]
  scoop install ngrok
  ```
  ```bash [Linux]
  # TODO
  ```
::

Save token just once after install (to have it, you need to create an account and check your dashboard : [**dashboard.ngrok.com/auth/your-authtoken**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth/your-authtoken))

```bash
ngrok authtoken random_token
```

**2 - Execute serve on your back-end application**

### Example for a Laravel application

```bash
php artisan serve
```

To get default <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

The application is available on port `8000`

**3 - And, in another tab, execute ngrok**

If the application is available on port `8000`, execute below command (change port if it's necessary)

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

**4 - You will have output like**

```bash
Forwarding                    http://random-generated-key.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
```

## Expose

Official documentation: [**beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction**](https://beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction)

**Install expose globaly with `composer`**

```bash
composer global require beyondcode/expose
```

**Set token** (to have this, create an account on [**beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction**](https://beyondco.de/docs/expose/introduction))

```bash
expose token xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Expose your Vhost, here `laravel-app.localhost` is the hypothetical Vhost**

```bash
expose share laravel-app.localhost
```

**You will have this output**

```bash
Local-URL:              laravel-app.localhost
Dashboard-URL:          http://127.0.0.1:4040
Expose-URL:             https://random-key.sharedwithexpose.com
```

**And you can connect your app to <https://random-key.sharedwithexpose.com>**
