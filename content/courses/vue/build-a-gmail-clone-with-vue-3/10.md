# Flexible Events

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-10-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-10-start)

In the last lesson we created the button toolbar for our email-reading modal.

```html
<div class="email-display">
    <div class="toolbar">
        <button @click="toggleArchive">{{email.archived ? 'Move to Inbox (e)' : 'Archive (e)'}}</button>
        <button @click="toggleRead">{{email.read ? 'Mark Unread (r)' : 'Mark Read (r)'}}</button>
        <button @click="goNewer">Newer (k)</button>
        <button @click="goOlder">Older (j)</button>
    </div>

    ...
</div>
```

There are four actions, but using the tools available in the `MailView` component, we can only fully accomplish `toggleRead`. We need to either pass down a bunch of tools from the `MailTable` component, or pass up instructions to the `MailTable` component via an event.

We’ll do the latter.

We’ll use an event called `changeEmail`, and we’ll tell it what needs to get done by passing arguments.

Let’s first emit the event, using arguments to make a ‘wish list’ of what we want to get done. We’ll start with `toggleArchive` and `toggleRead` .

```javascript
let toggleRead = () => emit('changeEmail', {toggleRead: true, save: true})
let toggleArchive = () => emit('changeEmail', {toggleArchive: true, save: true, closeModal: true})
```

We’re sending four different options: `toggleRead`, `save` , `toggleArchive` , and `closeModal` .

Our `changeEmail` event will have to handle all of those correctly.

Now we’ll fill out the other two methods from the buttons, and add two more that are just keyboard shortcuts. We’ll need just one more option for the event: `changeIndex`.

```javascript
setup({changeEmail}){
let toggleRead = () => emit('changeEmail', {toggleRead: true, save: true})
let toggleArchive = () => emit('changeEmail', {toggleArchive: true, save: true, closeModal: true})
let goNewer = () => emit('changeEmail', {changeIndex: -1})
let goOlder = () => emit('changeEmail', {changeIndex: 1})
let goNewerAndArchive = () => emit('changeEmail', {changeIndex: -1, toggleArchive: true})
let goOlderAndArchive = () => emit('changeEmail', {changeIndex: 1, toggleArchive: true})

useKeydown([
{key: 'e', fn: toggleArchive},
{key: 'r', fn: toggleRead},
{key: 'k', fn: goNewer},
{key: 'j', fn: goOlder},
{key: '[', fn: goNewerAndArchive},
{key: ']', fn: goOlderAndArchive}
])

return {
format,
marked,
toggleArchive,
toggleRead,
goNewer,
goOlder,
}
}
```

Then we’ll feed in the `changeEmail` event to the `MailView` component.

```html
<MailView v-if="openedEmail" :email="openedEmail" @changeEmail="changeEmail" />
```

Then we’ll create the `changeEmail` function itself. The argument names make them self-explanatory, and grouping them in an object means we can include or not include as we like, without worrying about order.

Also note that the openEmail method had to change, to account for the possibility of a null email (such as when hitting ‘older’ on the oldest email)

```javascript
methods: {
changeEmail({toggleRead, toggleArchive, save, closeModal, changeIndex}) {
let email = this.openedEmail;
if(toggleRead) { email.read = !email.read }
if(toggleArchive) { email.archived = !email.archived }
if(save) { this.updateEmail(email) }
if(closeModal) { this.openedEmail = null; }

if(changeIndex) {
let emails = this.unarchivedEmails
let currentIndex = emails.indexOf(this.openedEmail)
let newEmail = emails[currentIndex + changeIndex]
this.openEmail(newEmail)
}
},
openEmail(email){
this.openedEmail = email;

if(email) {
email.read = true
axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
}
},
//...
}
```

And now we’ve got a great set of actions we can perform on the email display modal - both through clicking buttons and through using keyboard shortcuts.

We’ve also got a useful pattern for communicating requests from a child component to a parent component.
