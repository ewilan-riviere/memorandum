# Axios & JSON Server

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: [https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-4-start](https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-4-start)

The last lesson was all about getting our app ready to handle asynchronous code using the Suspense component and an async setup function. This lesson will use that in order to pull code asynchronously from the server, then save updated data back to the server.

First, let’s set up our server. If you’re following along with the starter code, then run the following commands in your CLI, while in the root directory of this project:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
json-server --watch db.json
```

We’re using a file called db.json, included in the starter code, to create a simple REST server.

If you don’t have the file yet, you can create it and paste in the code below:

]
}
```

Visit `[http://localhost:3000/emails](http://localhost:3000/emails)` to see the result. It’s a REST Index of the emails.

Now let’s use that endpoint in our code.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
async setup(){
let response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/emails');
let emails = response.data;
return {
format,
emails
}
},
}
```

It works just as well as when we were loading the data directly.

You can use ES6 destructuring to make the code a bit shorter.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
async setup(){
let {data: emails} = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/emails');
return {
format,
emails
}
},
}
```

There’s more we can do, now that we’re storing our data in a file… now, instead of resetting everything when you reload, we can actually save the changes we make.

Let’s start with reading the emails…

```html
<tr v-for="email in unarchivedEmails" :key="email.id" :class="[email.read ? 'read': '', 'clickable']" @click="readEmail(email)">
```

```javascript
methods: {
readEmail(email){
email.read = true
axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
}
}
```

Click an email to read it, then reload, then you’ll see that it’s been saved!

Look at your db.json and see that it’s changed to reflect the newly read email.

Now let’s do that with the archive action:

```html
<td><button @click="archiveEmail(email)">Archive</button></td>
```

```javascript
archiveEmail(email){
email.archived = true;
axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
}
```

Finally, let’s put our PUT request in a new function, which we call from readEmail and openEmail, so that if we need to change how the email is updated, we only need to do it in one place.

```javascript
methods: {
readEmail(email) {
email.read = true
this.updateEmail(email)
},
archiveEmail(email) {
email.archived = true
this.updateEmail(email)
},
updateEmail(email) {
axios.put(`http://localhost:3000/emails/${email.id}`, email)
}
}
```
