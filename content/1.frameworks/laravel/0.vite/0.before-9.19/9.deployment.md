Clear cache.

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

Set `.env`.

```yaml [.env]
APP_ENV=production
#...
APP_DEBUG=false
```

Execute `build` command.

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will use `vite` to publish assets into `public/assets/dist`. In your `blade` template with `@vite` directive, template use build assets if your `APP_ENV` from `.env` is not on `local`.
