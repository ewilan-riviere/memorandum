# Auto deploy

When you push some modifications on your repo, your server not update automatically. If you use **webhooks**, you can send **push event** to your server execute `git pull` on your repo. But we need to receive this push event, it's call a **payload**, we have to configure server to receive it and update repository.

## Setup drone to watch push events

> Drone project is designed by [**adr1enbe4udou1n**](https://github.com/adr1enbe4udou1n), I just clone his project, thanks to him!

To watch **payloads**, we need to have a tool to receive it. It's goal of [**drone project**](https://gitlab.com/ewilan-riviere/drone), just clone it on your server, where you want, here I choose to clone it to `/home/jack/drone-manual`. It's NodeJS app, so use **PM2** to manage it.

Create drone with `git clone` in `~/`

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ewilan-riviere/drone drone-manual
```

Create **ecosystem** file

```js title="~/ecosystem.config.js"
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'deploy',
      script: 'index.js',
      cwd: '/home/jack/drone-manual',
      env: {
        PORT: 3001
      },
    },
    // some projects
  ]
}
```

Then configure `.env` file, just copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with infos:

```yaml [~/drone-manual/.env]
PORT=3001
WEBHOOK_PATH=/deploy
WEBSCRIPT_PATH=
SCRIPT_KEY=
PROJECTS_ROOT=/home/jack/www/
```

- `PORT`: port to deploy drone, 3000 by default
- `WEBHOOK_PATH`: url where drone listen, when we will configure Nginx, we use `dev.ewilan-riviere.com`, so listen url will be `dev.ewilan-riviere.com/deploy`
- `PROJECTS_ROOT`: absolute path where repositories cloned

Then create `repositories.json` into repo. It will useful only if remote have different name of cloned repo. But you need to have this file, even it's empty file.

```json title="~/drone-manual/repositories.json"
{
  "portfolio-front": [
    "portfolio-front"
  ]
}
```

Then configure Nginx like it:

- `root`: default root with just `index.php`
- `server_name`: example url `dev.ewilan-riviere.com`
- `location /deploy`: like **WEBHOOK_PATH** define in `.env` file
- `proxy_pass`: **3000** is the **PORT** define in `.env` file

Don't forget to enable this config.

## Setup repository webhook

GitHub example, webhooks are available into **Settings/Webhooks**. If you haven't configure HTTPS on your Nginx config disable **SSL verification**.

## Git hooks

When repo is updated, you need to execute some commands like `npm install` or `npm build` for example. To do this, you can use **git hooks**, it's script that you can configure when git event triggered. Check `repo/.git/hooks/` directory, it's available on all repositories and not gittable. If you want to execute commands after `git pull`, create a new script and name it `post-merge`.

At the root of repository create new bash script

```bash
vim .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Add commands to build app

```bash [.git/hooks/post-merge]
#!/bin/bash

yarn ; yarn build
```

Change rights on this file with this command:

```bash
sudo chmod 775 .git/hooks/post-merge
```

```bash
./.git/hooks/post-merge
```

All commands in this scripts will be executed after *git pull*.

### Git hooks examples

#### **Laravel**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear

composer install
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
composer install --no-dev

pnpm i ; pnpm prod
```

#### **VueJS with Yarn**

```bash [.git/hooks/post-merge]
#!/bin/bash

pnpm i ; pnpm build
```

#### **NuxtJS with pm2 - SSR mode**

> in this example it's NuxtJS application, `yarn` will build the app and pm2 restart daemon with `pm2 restart app_id` where `app_id` is the `name` of app in `ecosystem.config.js`

```bash [.git/hooks/post-merge]
#!/bin/bash

pnpm i ; pnpm build
pm2 restart app_id
```
