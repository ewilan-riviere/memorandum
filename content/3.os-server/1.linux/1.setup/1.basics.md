# Basics

This guide has been set for [**Ubuntu 20.04**](https://ubuntu.com/#download) and Debian 10, if you have another distribution use it carefully.

Update apt and upgrade packages

```bash
sudo apt update ; sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Install useful packages

```bash
sudo apt install -y zip unzip curl git vim ssh lsb-release ca-certificates apt-transport-https software-properties-common
```

Install `exFAT` packages (to use `exFAT` disks, [**see wiki**](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/exfat))

```bash
sudo apt install -y exfat-utils exfat-fuse
```

Install picture usage packages

```bash

## Vim

Get basic configuration and copy it to user directory

sudo vim /etc/vim/vimrc
```

```vim [/etc/vim/vimrc]
set nocompatible
set number
set background=dark
syntax on
set tabstop=4
set smartindent

## ZSH & Oh my ZSH

ZSH is a powerful command interpreter, better than bash. If you use it, you can improve it with [_Oh my ZSH_](https://ohmyz.sh/) which is configuration for ZSH.

_Install zsh_

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh
```

_Install oh-my-zsh_

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

::alert{type="warning"}
If you accept to use ZSH, you need to logout to enable it.

::alert{type="warning"}
If your shell don't persist you can add this line to `~/.bashrc` to enable it.

```bash
echo 'exec zsh' >> ~/.bashrc
```
::

### Customize with theme

With _Oh my ZSH_, you can use themes to have beautiful terminal, check available themes here: [github.com/ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes), I use `pmcgee`

To install a new theme, just edit `.zshrc`

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

Search `ZSH_THEME` at the top of file and update value

```diff [~/.zshrc]
-ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
+ZSH_THEME="pmcgee"
```

Update new configuration

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Extras

### exa a replacement for ‘ls’

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ogham/exa)

```bash
sudo apt install -y exa
```

Install `exa`

```bash
sudo apt install exa -y
```

Make alias in your PATH

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

```bash[~/.zshrc]
alias ls="exa"
alias ll="exa -al"
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use `exa` with `ls`.

### thefuck corrects your command

Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck#installation)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools
sudo apt install thefuck -y
```

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

```bash [~/.zshrc]
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
eval "$(thefuck --alias)"
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
