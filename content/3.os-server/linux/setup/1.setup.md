# Install

This guide has been set for [**Ubuntu 20.04**](https://ubuntu.com/#download) and Debian 10, if you have another distribution use it carefully.

## Useful packages

Update apt

```bash
sudo apt update ; sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Install useful packages

```bash
sudo apt install -y zip unzip curl git vim ssh lsb-release ca-certificates apt-transport-https software-properties-common
```

Install `exFAT` packages (to use `exFAT` disks, [**see wiki**](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/exfat))

sudo apt install -y exfat-utils exfat-fuse
```

```

```vim [/etc/vim/vimrc]

## ZSH & Oh my ZSH

ZSH is a powerful command interpreter, better than bash. If you use it, you can improve it with [_Oh my ZSH_](https://ohmyz.sh/) which is configuration for ZSH.

_Install zsh_

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh
```

_Install oh-my-zsh_

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

::alert{type="warning"}
If you accept to use ZSH, you need to logout to enable it.
::

### Customize with theme

With _Oh my ZSH_, you can use themes to have beautiful terminal, check available themes here: [github.com/ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes), I use `pmcgee`

To install a new theme, just edit `.zshrc`

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

Search `ZSH_THEME` at the top of file and update value

```diff [~/.zshrc]
-ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
+ZSH_THEME="pmcgee"
```

Update new configuration

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## NodeJS: NVM

You can install basic **NPM** package but with **NVM**, you can change NodeJS version when you want. Check last version on [**NVM GitHub**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and change it if you want latest. Here, the **NVM** version is **`0.39`** and **NodeJS** version is **`18.15.0`** LTS.

Download NVM

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Add this into `~/.zshrc`

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

```bash[.zshrc]
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use `nvm`, install Node.js `v18.15.0` and config `nvm` to use it

```bash
nvm ls-remote
nvm install 18.15.0
nvm use 18.15.0
nvm alias default 18.15.0
nvm use default
nvm ls
node -v
```

## PHP

To get latest versions of PHP

::code-group

```bash [Ubuntu]
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
```

```bash [Debian]
echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sury-php.list
wget -qO - https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
```

::

Install latest PHP version.

```bash
sudo apt -y install php8.2-fpm
```

Add PHP extension

```bash
sudo apt install -y php8.2-mbstring php8.2-mysql php8.2-common php8.2-mysql php8.2-xml php8.2-curl php8.2-gd php8.2-imagick php8.2-cli php8.2-dev php8.2-imap php8.2-mbstring php8.2-opcache php8.2-soap php8.2-zip php8.2-intl php8.2-bz2
```

To change PHP version

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```

### Composer

Use command line instructions of [**Composer website**](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download and install latest version of Composer

![composer](/docs/composer.jpg)

```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

You have just to copy installation instructions and composer will be download, this is an example:

```bash
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.config/composer/
```

To install global package like `laravel`

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Add this to `.zshrc`

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
```

```bash[~/.zshrc]
export PATH=~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use `composer`.
