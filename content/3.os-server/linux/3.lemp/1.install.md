## NGINX & firewall

::alert{type="info"}
If you don't allow NGINX on firewall, your domain cannot be loaded.
::

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

Configure firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

## MySQL / MariaDB

Install MySQL or MariaDB

::code-group
  ```bash [Ubuntu]
  sudo apt install -y mysql-server
  sudo mysql_secure_installation
  ```
  ```bash [Debian]
  sudo apt install -y mariadb-server
  sudo mysql_secure_installation
  ```
::

::alert{type="info"}
**About installation**
>
- Choose password level, I advice `LOW` to avoid problems with password.
- Define password
- Select `Yes` for all questions after this.
::

Connect to MySQL CLI

::code-group
  ```bash [Ubuntu]
  sudo mysql -u root -p
  ```
  ```bash [Debian]
  sudo mariadb -u root -p
  ```
::

Redefine `validate_password.policy` if necessary and `root` password if necessary

::code-group
  ```sql [mysql]
  SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy=LOW;
  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'super_secret_password';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
  ```bash [mariadb]
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password');
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
::

> It's not a good idea to have one user to manage all databases, `root` user is useful to create database and users but only with MySQL CLI and not with phpMyAdmin because phpMyAdmin have online access. It's a good idea to create ONE user BY database and give rights about this database only to this NEW user (and `root` of course). And, the most important, in your application, give new user for credentials. With this solution, your credentials can only manage ONE database, it's more secure if someone find credentials.

Here, it's an example of this solution, `my_project_database` and `my_project_user` can be same.

::code-group
  ```sql [mysql]
  CREATE DATABASE my_project_database;
  CREATE USER 'my_project_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'secret_password';
  GRANT ALL ON my_project_database.* TO 'my_project_user'@'localhost';
  ```
  ```bash [mariadb]
  CREATE DATABASE `my_project_database`;
  CREATE USER 'my_project_user'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'super_secret_password';
  GRANT ALL privileges ON my_project_database.* TO 'my_project_user'@localhost;
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
::

::alert{type="danger"}
Give all rights to one user, except root but root will be disable for phpMyAdmin.

```bash
CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```

## PHP

Check [Linux setup](/os-server/linux/php) to install PHP.

---

## Virtual Host

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G www-data $USER
```

NGINX is setup but now, we have to setup Virtual hosts (or VHost). We take a basic example with just PHP 8.2 and an `index.php`, but it's same concept for any PHP app like Laravel or Symfony.

Create NGINX conf for this app

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-domain.localhost
```

Insert these infos and save file

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  root /var/www/my-domain;
  index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
  server_name my-domain.localhost;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
  }

  location ~ /\.ht {
    deny all;
  }
}
```

Setup rights on web server folder `/var/www`, create root folder for the app and `index.php`

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data /var/www
sudo mkdir /var/www/my-domain
sudo touch /var/www/my-domain/index.php
sudo vim /var/www/my-domain/index.php
```

Fill `index.php` with basic infos

```html [/var/www/my-domain/index.php]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Domain</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; margin: 5rem 0">
    This is my new domain!
    <br/>
    <?php
      echo $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE'];
    ?>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Make symbolic link with NGINX conf and `sites-enabled` to enable this conf, check NGINX configuration and reload NGINX to refresh web server

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-domain.localhost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
```

And now, you can access to you domain to [**http://my-domain.localhost**](http://my-domain.localhost)

**Next step: install and configure phpMyAdmin**

### Allow big files uploading

NGINX default conf allow 2 Mo files max in upload, if you want to change it follow these steps

::alert{type="info"}
> **NGINX**

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Change or add this line

```nginx {3}
http {
  # ...
  client_max_body_size 500M;
}
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
> **PHP**

Check PHP version used by your application, `php -v` give you just PHP CLI version, if don't setup VHost, it's PHP version of your app but if you have a VHost you have to check PHP version of conf. And update current `php.ini`

For example if current version is 8.2 (found with `php --ini`)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini
```

Search and change these lines

```ini
post_max_size = 500M
# ...
upload_max_filesize = 500M
```
::

Restart NGINX and PHP

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
sudo service php8.2-fpm restart
```

You can check with `phpinfo()`.

### PHP version and NGINX

When you execute `php` command into your terminal, you have a current PHP version than you can check it with `php -v`. But yours VHosts can always use old version of PHP, you will have to update NGINX conf for each VHost if you want to change their version of PHP (it's optional). You can keep VHost with old version of PHP, if you let this version on your system, it's useful to update version if you use modern syntax in your PHP app, for example type of parameters is available with latests PHP versions.

::alert{type="warning"}
Following steps talks about VHost, if you don't know how it's works, read *4. Virtual Host* before.
::

If you want to update a VHost NGINX conf, check it in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and edit it, like:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-domain
```

You will have some infos but search this line

```nginx {5}
server {
  # ...
  location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
  }
  #...
}
```

In this example, this VHost use PHP 7.2 version but if you installed PHP 8.0, you can update it

```nginx {5}
server {
  # ...
  location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock;
  }
  #...
}
```

And your app will use new PHP version.

::alert{type="warning"}
If you change PHP version, it can be missing some extensions, if your app display an error about extension check this part : *missing extension*
::

## Troubles

List virtual hosts with Nginx

```bash
grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI
```

Uninstall NGINX

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

### VHost works on Chrome but not on Firefox
