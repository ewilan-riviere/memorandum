# Download with browser

This article was written using a **Kobo (Clara HD)** to present the use of a web browser with an eReader. Therefore the screenshots presented to show how to use the browser are related to the Kobo interface. Most eReaders offer a browser but its location may differ from one eReader to another, so please refer to specialized articles on your eReader if the present guide is not enough to find it. **If your eReader don't offer any browser, you can't use this guide.**

With your eReader you can download an eBook directly from Internet. To do this, you need to use your eReader's web browser to find a website that will offer you a direct download of an .epub file. The goal is to perform almost the same action as when you download a recently purchased eBook from your eReader's internal store, if your eReader offers one.

## Find your Internet browser

From the Kobo browser example, from the eReader's home screen, tap on "More" in bottom navigation and then choose "Beta Features"...

...and tap on "**Start**" in "**Web Browser**".

This will open the home page, usually on Google, you have **URL bar at the top**, **back, next & refresh buttons at the bottom** with a zoom bar, don't leave out the three dots indicating additional options at the bottom right as **you can add websites as favorites**.
