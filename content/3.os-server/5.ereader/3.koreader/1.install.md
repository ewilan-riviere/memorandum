  - Linux:  Download the Linux install script archive, and unzip it in the same folder. Run the install.sh script with your favorite terminal emulator.
  - macOS: ownload the macOS install script archive, and unzip it in the same folder. Run the install.command script (Right Click > Open > Then click Open in the GateKeeper popup)
  - Windows:  Download the Windows install script, in the same folder. On recent Windows versions (i.e., when running PowerShell >= 7), you'll have to "unblock" the script to allow it to run. (Right Click > Tick Unblock in the bottom-right corner).
