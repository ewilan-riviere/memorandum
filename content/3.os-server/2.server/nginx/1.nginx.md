# NGINX

- Official: <http://nginx.org/>

## Install

These instructions are for Debian 10 or more, if you have another distribution use it carefully.

### From default SourcesList (deprecated)

::alert{type="warning"}
This method will install an old version of NGINX, you should use the official repository.
::

Install standard version

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

- The default user of NGINX with this method is `www-data`
- The configuration files are in `/etc/nginx/`
- The logs are in `/var/log/nginx/`
- The default web root is `/var/www/html/`
- Web server configuration is in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

### From NGINX Repository

::alert{type="info"}
This method is recommended to have the latest version of NGINX, you will have access to the latest features like new syntax for `http2`.
::

From <http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#Debian>

```bash
sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release debian-archive-keyring
```

Import an official nginx signing key so apt could verify the packages authenticity.

```bash
curl https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | gpg --dearmor \
| sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
```

Verify that the downloaded file contains the proper key.

```bash
gpg --dry-run --quiet --no-keyring --import --import-options import-show /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg
```

To set up the apt repository.

- **Stable**, doesnâ€™t include all of the latest features, but has critical bug fixes that are always backported to the mainline version. We recommend the stable version for production servers.
- **Mainline**, includes the latest features and bug fixes and is always up to date. It is reliable, but it may include some experimental modules, and it may also have some number of new bugs.

::code-group
  ```bash [Stable]
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg] \
  http://nginx.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` nginx" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
  ```
  ```bash [Mainline]
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-archive-keyring.gpg] \
  http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian `lsb_release -cs` nginx" \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
  ```
::

Set up repository pinning to prefer our packages over distribution-provided ones

```bash
echo -e "Package: *\nPin: origin nginx.org\nPin: release o=nginx\nPin-Priority: 900\n" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/99nginx
```

Now, NGINX repository replace default APT `nginx` package, so you can install NGINX

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

- The default user of NGINX with this method is `nginx`
- The configuration files are in `/etc/nginx/`
- The logs are in `/var/log/nginx/`
- The default web root is `/usr/share/nginx/html/`
- Web server configuration is in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`

## Permissions

You can add NGINX user to current user group for permissions

- For default repository: `www-data`
- For official repository: `nginx`

::alert{type="info"}
To know NGINX user, you can see the configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and search for `user` directive.

```nginx [/etc/nginx/nginx.conf]
user  nginx; # this is the default user, can be www-data too
```
::

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G $USER nginx # or www-data
id $USER
groups $USER
```

## Firewall

Allow NGINX in firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

See firewall rules

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

You will see something like this

```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere
80 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

Ports 80 and 443 are open.

::alert{type="warning"}
You can only open 443 if you have an SSL certificate, but if your certificate is not valid, website will not work, port 80 is used as a fallback.
::

## Version

```bash
sudo nginx -V
```

You will see something like this a version like `nginx/1.22.4` for default repository or `nginx/1.26.0` for the official repository.

## Restart

When you change the configuration, you need to restart the service.

```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

## Update

To update NGINX, you can use this command

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y nginx
```

## Create new domain

To create a new domain, you can create a new configuration file.

The place of configuration files is different between default and official repositories.

- Default repository (1.22.4): `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
- Official repository (1.26.0): `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`

::alert{type="info"}
With the default repository, you need to create a symbolic link to `sites-enabled` to activate the domain.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-website /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

For the official repository, you don't need to create a symbolic link, just create a new file in `conf.d` directory.
::

Here we will see how to create a new domain with the official repository.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-website.conf
```

```nginx [/etc/nginx/conf.d/my-website.conf]
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name my-website.com www.my-website.com;

  location / {
    root /var/www/my-website;
    index index.html;
  }
}
```

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/my-website
sudo chown -R $USER:nginx /var/www/my-website
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/my-website
```

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
```

::alert{type="info"}
If you have this output, everything is fine, otherwise you will have some infos to fix it:

> nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
> nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
::

## SSL

To use SSL, you need to have a certificate. You can use Let's Encrypt to have a free certificate, to install it you have a guide here: [SSL Certbot](/os-server/server/nginx/certbot).

You will have some questions to answer, and after that, you will have a certificate.

::alert{type="info"}
If you have a certificate, you can use HTTPS, and you need to redirect all HTTP to HTTPS.

<details>
<summary>HTTP to HTTPS</summary>
```nginx [/etc/nginx/conf.d/my-website.conf]
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name my-website.com www.my-website.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name my-website.com www.my-website.com;

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-website.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-website.com/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    root /var/www/my-website;
    index index.html;
  }
}
```
</details>
::

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
```

If you have an error, you can see the logs in `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.

## Node.js application

To host PHP application or HTML files, you can use NGINX, but if you want to host a Node.js application, you can use PM2 to manage your application with NGINX as a reverse proxy.

You can see a guide here: [Node.js with PM2](/os-server/server/nginx/nodejs-pm2).

## Remove domain

To remove a domain, you can delete the configuration file with official repository and remove the symbolic link with default repository.

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-website.conf
```

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx reload
```

## See all NGINX domains

To see all domains in NGINX, you can use this command

```bash
sudo nginx -T | grep "server_name "
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, but you can include other files in this file.

```nginx [/etc/nginx/nginx.conf]
user  nginx; # this is the default user, can be www-data too

# ...

http {
  # ...
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; # include all files in this directory
}
```

Examples of configuration files.
