# NGINX

::alert{type="warning"}
scoop and PHP are necessary
::

Here you will need to have **NSSM**, I give more details in **PHP guide**.

Install **NGINX** with **scoop**

```powershell [PowerShell]
scoop install nginx
```

## Create nginx

And install a new service, here for NGINX

```powershell [PowerShell]
sudo nssm install nginx
```

You will have a window to create new service, set `path` with `nginx.exe` path.

For **Path**, get **path** of **current** **nginx**, in this example change `USERNAME`

```ps1 [Path]
C:\Users\USERNAME\scoop\apps\nginx\current\nginx.exe
```

```ps1 [Service name]
nginx
```

Save the new service and start it:

```powershell [PowerShell]
sudo nssm start nginx
```

In any browser, at <http://localhost>, you have to see **NGINX welcome** page.

## Restart nginx

If you change some data, like with **nginx.conf**, you will need to **restart Service**.

```powershell [PowerShell]
sudo nssm restart nginx
```

## Add a new VHost

Add a new VHost to **nginx.conf**: `C:\Users\USERNAME\scoop\apps\nginx\current\conf\nginx.conf`

- Add `server_names_hash_bucket_size  64;` to `http` block (just once, not for each VHost)
- If you want a VHost check example `server` block with `server_name laravel.localhost;`

::callout{type="info"}
#summary
**nginx.conf**
#content

```nginx:C:\Users\USERNAME\scoop\apps\nginx\current\conf\nginx.conf

# ...

events {
    # ...
}

http {
    # ...

    # 'server_names_hash_bucket_size' for VHost
    server_names_hash_bucket_size  64;

    # default server
    server {
        # ...
    }

    # Example of 'server' block for Laravel (with PHP 7.4)
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name app.laravel.test;
        root "C:/workspace/laravel/public";
        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9074;
            include        fastcgi.conf;
        }
    }

    # ...

}
```

::

You have update **nginx.conf**, so you need to restart NGINX Service:

```powershell [PowerShell]
sudo nssm restart nginx
```

## hosts

You will need to update **hosts** to have a new VHost, you will find it here: _C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts_. Open it with any IDE and, **at the end**, add two lines for each VHost with same `server_name` of `server` block. In my example, the `server_name` is `server_name app.laravel.test`

```ini:C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
127.0.0.1       app.laravel.test
::1             app.laravel.test
```

To save it, you need to be admin, you can use Visual Studio Code if you have any problems.

---

In any browser, at <http://app.laravel.test>, you have to see the app (for some browser, you will need to restart it).
