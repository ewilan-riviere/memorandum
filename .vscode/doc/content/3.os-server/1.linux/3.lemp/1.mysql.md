::alert{type="info"}
**About installation**
>
- Choose password level, I advice `LOW` to avoid problems with password.
- Define password
- Select `Yes` for all questions after this.
::

Connect to MySQL CLI

::code-group
  ```bash [Ubuntu]
  sudo mysql -u root -p
  ```
  ```bash [Debian]
  sudo mariadb -u root -p
  ```
::

Redefine `validate_password.policy` if necessary and `root` password if necessary

::code-group
  ```sql [mysql]
  SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy=LOW;
  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'super_secret_password';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
  ```bash [mariadb]
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password');
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```

> It's not a good idea to have one user to manage all databases, `root` user is useful to create database and users but only with MySQL CLI and not with phpMyAdmin because phpMyAdmin have online access. It's a good idea to create ONE user BY database and give rights about this database only to this NEW user (and `root` of course). And, the most important, in your application, give new user for credentials. With this solution, your credentials can only manage ONE database, it's more secure if someone find credentials.

Here, it's an example of this solution, `my_project_database` and `my_project_user` can be same.

::code-group
  ```sql [mysql]
  CREATE DATABASE my_project_database;
  CREATE USER 'my_project_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'secret_password';
  GRANT ALL ON my_project_database.* TO 'my_project_user'@'localhost';
  ```
  ```bash [mariadb]
  CREATE DATABASE `my_project_database`;
  CREATE USER 'my_project_user'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'super_secret_password';
  GRANT ALL privileges ON my_project_database.* TO 'my_project_user'@localhost;
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
::

::alert{type="danger"}
Give all rights to one user, except root but root will be disable for phpMyAdmin.

```bash
CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```
