## `semi-colon expected`

Common error with Vetur with **@apply** Tailwind directive. Usse `postcss` as attribute to avoid this error.

```html
<style lang="css"></style>
```

## `value.charCodeAt is not a function`

```sh
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/src/...):TypeError: value.charCodeAt is not a function
```

If you have an error like this, maybe you tried to upgrade Tailwind from v1 to v2. Try to remove Tailwind plugins which are not compatibles with Tailwind v2 like `@tailwindcss/ui` from `plugins` in `tailwind.config.js`.
